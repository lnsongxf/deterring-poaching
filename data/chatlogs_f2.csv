contracts_punish,Periodcontracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,3,hellocontracts_chat,5,hicontracts_chat,2,hicontracts_chat,4,hicontracts_chat,1,hey guyscontracts_chat,3,Does anyone know how to get a maximum return?contracts_chat,5,What's the point of this chat?contracts_chat,1,"There's no point in the deductions, is there"contracts_chat,2,should we decide how much to invest?contracts_chat,3,no point in the deductionscontracts_chat,1,"i looked at the table, 40 tokens = 600 dollars"contracts_chat,5,so we shouldn't deduct anything?contracts_chat,3,i say all of itcontracts_chat,2,No :\contracts_chat,5,Nocontracts_chat,1,600 dollars is the highestcontracts_chat,5,so invest all token?contracts_chat,1,Nopecontracts_chat,1,so if we each put in 4 tokenscontracts_chat,4,Is it beneficial to us to assign deductions contracts_chat,1,that's 40 tokenscontracts_chat,5,okay lets all do 4 thencontracts_chat,3,we each get 12 tokens contracts_chat,3,no?contracts_chat,1,yescontracts_chat,2,surecontracts_chat,1,On the chart the most is at 40 tokenscontracts_chat,1,so put in 4 tokens guys?contracts_chat,1,it's the bestcontracts_chat,5,yeah sounds goodcontracts_chat,3,okcontracts_chat,4,okcontracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,2,okay why do i have a deductioncontracts_chat,5,did you guys do 4 tokens the second time?contracts_chat,1,I think for everyone to achieve the most is if everyone invest 8contracts_chat,3,alright everyone should invest 12contracts_chat,1,and no one deducts anythingcontracts_chat,1,why 12contracts_chat,2,yea i agreecontracts_chat,4,so we want to try to get total investment around 40 rightcontracts_chat,3,"yeah, who keeps giving ppl deductions?"contracts_chat,1,if we put too many tokens we will get less moneycontracts_chat,5,i didntcontracts_chat,3,"but group 2 also invests, they invested 21 last turn"contracts_chat,1,I didn'tcontracts_chat,3,i didntcontracts_chat,1,okay 4 lolcontracts_chat,4,what happened to puttin in 4contracts_chat,3,hahahcontracts_chat,5,so we're gonna keep doing 4?contracts_chat,3,we as a group should shoot for about 5 eachcontracts_chat,3,why 4?contracts_chat,1,let's do 5contracts_chat,1,We as a whole want to invest approximately 40contracts_chat,2,its just your optionscontracts_chat,1,if everyone does 5 it's 40 tokenscontracts_chat,5,i did 5 the second time and got less moneycontracts_chat,1,and if theres 5 of us thats 8 eachcontracts_chat,4,if we all put in 4 (like group 2 has) we get the max returncontracts_chat,1,but clearly 3 put like 10 -.-contracts_chat,3,but group 2 also counts towards the totalcontracts_chat,5,so wat do we docontracts_chat,4,so only do deductions if its above 40contracts_chat,1,ok so put around 3-5 contracts_chat,1,don't go over pleasecontracts_chat,4,which gave them a good return but lessened the overall return for the groupcontracts_chat,1,^Yescontracts_chat,5,so 4 lolcontracts_chat,3,alrightcontracts_chat,3,4 sounds goodcontracts_chat,5,okieecontracts_chat,4,ok goodcontracts_chat,5,rightcontracts_chat,1,if you go over you're a greedy person :)contracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,4,good work teamcontracts_chat,1,yeah that was pretty goodcontracts_chat,3,nicecontracts_chat,5,what should we do nowcontracts_chat,2,can we all invest more?contracts_chat,3,"lets try it, why not"contracts_chat,1,How are we doing?contracts_chat,3,like 6-8?contracts_chat,5,yeahcontracts_chat,1,haha whaat..contracts_chat,5,i think that round went bettercontracts_chat,3,"haha im not sure, its harder to calculate the profits than i though"contracts_chat,1,group 2 is gonna hate uscontracts_chat,5,so are we doing 6-8?contracts_chat,2,that sounds finecontracts_chat,3,im thinking we should all put in 6 or 7contracts_chat,3,yupcontracts_chat,4,i cant really tell if im doing it right contracts_chat,2,just to see what happenscontracts_chat,4,if we all continue puttin in 3-5 we'll each make like $30 real moneycontracts_chat,5,alrightcontracts_chat,4,and keep getting the maxcontracts_chat,1,^ what 4 saidcontracts_chat,3,combined with what group 2 puts in the pot should be around 50contracts_chat,2,"6 or 7 as Your investment"" ?"""contracts_chat,3,yescontracts_chat,2,so keep doing 3-5 ?contracts_chat,5,and we'll make less if we do more?contracts_chat,1,The pot should be 40contracts_chat,4,40 is idealcontracts_chat,1,so should we go lowercontracts_chat,1,to get the max outcomecontracts_chat,1,we might make make more in one roundcontracts_chat,1,but group 2 will get revengecontracts_chat,5,yes go lowercontracts_chat,4,they are putting in around 20 each timecontracts_chat,1,hahahacontracts_chat,1,so everyone at 5contracts_chat,1,so 3-5 contracts_chat,4,so we should also do thatcontracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,5,has everyone been doing 5 stillcontracts_chat,3,that was goodcontracts_chat,1,"We're still a little high, we should be dropping down a little"contracts_chat,1,group 2 is getting greedycontracts_chat,4,yo someone from group 2 keeps putting in like 9 and getting way more money than everyone elsecontracts_chat,1,we need to shut them down hahahacontracts_chat,3,haha yeahcontracts_chat,2,sorry to say but i deducted from group 2contracts_chat,3,"lets give them a few deduction if they do that again,"contracts_chat,5,lol what should we do this round?contracts_chat,3,lol same herecontracts_chat,5,what should we drop down tocontracts_chat,4,i keep deducting them lolcontracts_chat,3,4-6 is working wellcontracts_chat,1,"if they go beyond 6 tokens this time, let's take 5 from them"contracts_chat,5,lolcontracts_chat,3,same...contracts_chat,2,lol why notcontracts_chat,1,"If the pot should be 40, they're around 20 every time, so we should be around then too"contracts_chat,4,if anyone goes beyond 6 this time let's deductcontracts_chat,1,"Yeah I see that person, I've been deducting them too"contracts_chat,4,so like 4-5 eachcontracts_chat,3,"lets do a little more, then we recieve a larger share of a pot that decreases very little"contracts_chat,5,deduct 1 from each of us?contracts_chat,1,preferably stay at 5 pleasecontracts_chat,5,okay and ill deduct them if they keep doing itcontracts_chat,3,so like 5 or 6contracts_chat,5,or 5 eachcontracts_chat,4,from the ppl who went overcontracts_chat,1,Just deduct who ever is highercontracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,1,the second round was greatcontracts_chat,2,agreecontracts_chat,5,yescontracts_chat,3,mmmhmmcontracts_chat,4,a+contracts_chat,1,the two people who did 7tokens in the first roundcontracts_chat,4,Being selfish is going to get you more than everyone else each time but if we work as a team we will get more in total therefore more for you in the long runcontracts_chat,1,that was funnycontracts_chat,3,im not sure that one person on group 2 putting in 12 all the time is getting the messagecontracts_chat,3,lolcontracts_chat,2,i think between 5-6 is finecontracts_chat,5,yeah i agreecontracts_chat,4,let's do thatcontracts_chat,3,"i agree, with what ou are saying"contracts_chat,3,okaycontracts_chat,1,agreedcontracts_chat,3,i will put dow 5 the next 2

contracts_chat,1,OKcontracts_chat,5,me toocontracts_chat,3,yeah i havecontracts_chat,2,okcontracts_chat,4,or we could all invest 5 instead of 6contracts_chat,1,why not bothcontracts_chat,2,are we doing well?contracts_chat,1,"we invest 5, and we deduct group 2"contracts_chat,5,yeah that would be optimal. and should we deduct from group 2 if they do more than 5?contracts_chat,3,the total pot has decreased the last 2 turns and my payoffs are looking better. We are all making like 160/170 a turncontracts_chat,4,sounds good ^contracts_chat,4,we should be trying to get the total at 40contracts_chat,2,agreedcontracts_chat,3,okaycontracts_chat,5,so everyone do 5contracts_chat,3,im not spending a lot of money on deductions now eithercontracts_chat,3,i would say socontracts_chat,5,and deduct from group 2 if they do more than 5contracts_chat,3,and deduct from group 2 contracts_chat,5,agreed?contracts_chat,4,okcontracts_chat,2,so we all invest 5?contracts_chat,3,yupcontracts_chat,2,how much total should be spending on deductions?contracts_chat,5,yescontracts_chat,1,yupcontracts_chat,4,yescontracts_chat,2,okcontracts_chat,1,deduct 2 points ?contracts_chat,3,okcontracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,5,im pissed. that person from group 2 who invested 9...i deducted 3 points lolcontracts_chat,1,lol i got so mad i deducted 20 points from that guycontracts_chat,3,wow group 2 contracts_chat,3,hahahacontracts_chat,1,twicecontracts_chat,5,hahah stupidcontracts_chat,3,i deducted 5contracts_chat,4,what the fuck group 2contracts_chat,5,hahah nice work team. hopefully that scared that personcontracts_chat,2,can we try that we invest in like 6 and just make sure that they don't go over 5contracts_chat,4,alright lets press continuecontracts_chat,2,?contracts_chat,5,the other members in group two kept theirs at 5-6 so thats good. keep deducting if they do past 5contracts_chat,3,im fine with thatcontracts_chat,3,yupcontracts_chat,4,samecontracts_chat,5,so we do 6 now?contracts_chat,3,surecontracts_chat,5,okaycontracts_chat,2,yupcontracts_chat,5,we're on round 14 right?contracts_chat,1,kaycontracts_chat,5,13contracts_chat,5,i meancontracts_chat,1,13contracts_chat,5,ok contracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,3,it worked!contracts_chat,2,keep the same (6) for the last one or do something else?contracts_chat,5,yeah it did!contracts_chat,4,keep it the samecontracts_chat,1,I wanna say keep the samecontracts_chat,1,Last one guys.
