contracts_punish,Periodcontracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,3,ellocontracts_chat,3,I think we should all invest 6contracts_chat,4,Ciaocontracts_chat,1,ideally we want to get to 40contracts_chat,2,"Since we are in group 1 we are 5 people, we invest 8 dollars each\"contracts_chat,5,it makes most sense if we try to get everyone to put in 5 tokens to get the most pyaoffcontracts_chat,2,to get to 40contracts_chat,4,im cool with thatcontracts_chat,5,okaycontracts_chat,3,so 5 points apiececontracts_chat,1,works for mecontracts_chat,1,yuhh.contracts_chat,4,lets also not deduct points from each othercontracts_chat,1,i bet group two does morecontracts_chat,3,and hope that group 2 understandscontracts_chat,5,5 points each is goodcontracts_chat,2,40 tokens in the account gives max pay outcontracts_chat,5,no duductions on my end toocontracts_chat,2,so agreedcontracts_chat,4,then 5?contracts_chat,4,so we are investing 5 each?contracts_chat,4,oh njkcontracts_chat,5,yes 5contracts_chat,1,k lets go yeah everyone continuecontracts_chat,4,kcontracts_chat,5,kcontracts_chat,2,k\contracts_chat,3,have to take in account what group 2 will docontracts_chat,2,lets see how this round goes. We aren't sure what group B will put into the account contracts_chat,3,maybe 4 would be better cuz group 2 will likely contribute more tokenscontracts_chat,4,so 6?contracts_chat,2,not a bad pointcontracts_chat,2,they are less peoplecontracts_chat,3,and the payoff from 30-40 tokens total is kinda similarcontracts_chat,2,i say 6 for this round. We can change the amount if we notice group b is adding in more/ lesscontracts_chat,3,6 it iscontracts_chat,1,yeah i think six is bestcontracts_chat,4,kcontracts_chat,2,should we do a test of 5 firstcontracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,2,group B is adding more coins in than we need contracts_chat,4,the more that we invest the bettercontracts_chat,1,We should all give the group 2 member a penaltycontracts_chat,2,What do you all think about adding 5 in each to offset their additioncontracts_chat,3,lmao yeacontracts_chat,5,but if we keep investing a lot we will go to the negativescontracts_chat,2,agreedcontracts_chat,1,it will scare them out of investing more i think. contracts_chat,4,lets do 8contracts_chat,3,lets do 5contracts_chat,4,guys dont put anything down for deductions it doesnt help anyone and i think we can do 5contracts_chat,4,who is deducting 33 points!!! :[contracts_chat,5,fine with mecontracts_chat,2,i agree. i don't see the point in deducting. it negitively affects you and the people you deduct fromcontracts_chat,4,coolcontracts_chat,2,not mecontracts_chat,1,i say we do like 6 or 7 and each throw a deduction at the random group 2contracts_chat,2,agreencontracts_chat,2,agreed*contracts_chat,1,i also agree. 5 it iscontracts_chat,5,kcontracts_chat,4,alright so lets all put in 8 pointscontracts_chat,4,i think its more to see if we will deduct points from people given the opportunitycontracts_chat,2,lets do 6contracts_chat,1,compromise and do 7contracts_chat,4,but we don't benefit from it so it doesn't mattercontracts_chat,4,the more we put in the more we makecontracts_chat,1,and punish the group 2contracts_chat,1,k gocontracts_chat,2,if we do 8 we'll already be at 40contracts_chat,3,yea screw the #2 and make them know they shouldnt investcontracts_chat,2,agreed. contracts_chat,5,works for me'contracts_chat,4,7 it iscontracts_chat,1,if they invest less well benefitcontracts_chat,3,okay 5 it is everyonecontracts_chat,2,yescontracts_chat,4,yupcontracts_chat,3,shun #2contracts_chat,2,yuuuuupcontracts_chat,2,smdcontracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,1,should we try to condition them?contracts_chat,5,Ive been doing worse putting in morecontracts_chat,3,the deductions are for group 2contracts_chat,2,obviouslycontracts_chat,4,ahhcontracts_chat,3,hey lets just keep deducting from #2....split it 5 wayscontracts_chat,2,hahah those greedy people..contracts_chat,5,i think 5 is safe contracts_chat,3,we need to deduct from them when they aren't doing what they shouldcontracts_chat,4,i think if we all put in 7 it wokrs wellcontracts_chat,1,like if they go above 5 punish them huge and if they stay below we let them off without a punishmentcontracts_chat,2,oooh i seecontracts_chat,1,yeah we should each put 7 in. contracts_chat,5,but it only affects one person not the whole groupcontracts_chat,2,how many deductionscontracts_chat,4,lol so what do we do?contracts_chat,3,yea 7 works good and keep deducting from any 2 that invests more that a few contracts_chat,1,right.contracts_chat,4,not if WE ALL do itcontracts_chat,4,"but if we start deducting from them they will from us, yes or no?"contracts_chat,2,so how many are we putting this timecontracts_chat,1,invest 7contracts_chat,3,7contracts_chat,3,they can'tcontracts_chat,2,yes they will . contracts_chat,1,deduct from 2contracts_chat,2,oh true!contracts_chat,5,7 for all the roundscontracts_chat,4,"SO ALL put in 7, NOT 4 "contracts_chat,1,rightcontracts_chat,3,i think only one cancontracts_chat,5,and 2 deduction on the group 2contracts_chat,3,and im not sure about thatcontracts_chat,3,and whatever #2 has for $ we all deduct him down to zero by splitting the cost 5 wayscontracts_chat,2,i just read it.contracts_chat,2,thats truecontracts_chat,5,so how much should we investcontracts_chat,4,7?contracts_chat,4,so how much deduction for eachcontracts_chat,4,?contracts_chat,1,why 7?contracts_chat,3,but i say we stick with 5 for investingcontracts_chat,2,too high contracts_chat,2,5contracts_chat,4,okcontracts_chat,2,5contracts_chat,4,5 it iscontracts_chat,1,5 workscontracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,5,7 is goodcontracts_chat,4,i agreecontracts_chat,5,people who put in 6 got lesscontracts_chat,2,so much for sticking to the plan. contracts_chat,1,someones being illogicalcontracts_chat,3,yea alternate bewteen 6 and 7contracts_chat,2,coolcontracts_chat,4,question are we getting paid the total payoff by the conversion rate? and lol yeah ikcontracts_chat,5,why alternatecontracts_chat,4,Persons 2 and 3 folllow the rules contracts_chat,4,do we want to do 5 or change it?contracts_chat,3,odd members do 7 on odd turns and even do odd on even turnscontracts_chat,3,keep it at 5contracts_chat,1,make sure we keep deducting from group 2. theyll get the hint and well end up benefittingcontracts_chat,2,clearly no one is going to do 5. contracts_chat,1,5 defcontracts_chat,5,but if we all put in 7 and continue deductions that workscontracts_chat,4,okiecontracts_chat,3,who put 12?contracts_chat,5,okaycontracts_chat,3,alternate to ensure its staying at around 45-50contracts_chat,1,i agree with member 5contracts_chat,4,that was group 2 i thotcontracts_chat,2,how many deductions should we putcontracts_chat,4,Tcontracts_chat,2,nope it was in group onecontracts_chat,3,nocontracts_chat,5,wait so who alternates whencontracts_chat,4,7**contracts_chat,2,someone needs to be voted off the island contracts_chat,4,and whoever did got the highest payout :/contracts_chat,2,if we put 5 each its 100 deductedcontracts_chat,4,lol contracts_chat,4,how about no one alternatescontracts_chat,3,everyone has to do 5contracts_chat,4,kcontracts_chat,1,5 it iscontracts_chat,4," jsut do 7, its easy to folle"contracts_chat,3,if anyone goes over 5 deduct from themcontracts_chat,5,yeah if we do 5 deductiona nd all 7 we are goodcontracts_chat,2,lets go 2 rounds no alternating and putting 5 deduction pointscontracts_chat,1,we need to get them down to 0 in group two so they prefer to keep their coinscontracts_chat,4,got itcontracts_chat,3,if group 2 goes over 5 deductcontracts_chat,2,cool\contracts_chat,2,let's see if you all are telling the truth contracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,5,what if group 2 is a computercontracts_chat,3,who went over 5contracts_chat,4,lets try something newcontracts_chat,4,everyone except 1 did 5contracts_chat,5,and they wont respond to what we docontracts_chat,2,dont think it iscontracts_chat,4,number 1 did 7contracts_chat,4,i feel like we are lozing moneycontracts_chat,5,go back to 5contracts_chat,1,if we drop back to 5 each we will make a bit morecontracts_chat,2,last round we went upcontracts_chat,3,lets do 5 now\contracts_chat,5,we all made more thencontracts_chat,5,lets do 5contracts_chat,3,everyone start deducting 5 from whoever goes overcontracts_chat,2,work as a group and we will get a better pay off #1contracts_chat,2,"if 5 doesnt work round 9, lets go back to 7"contracts_chat,4,okcontracts_chat,4,yupcontracts_chat,1,sounds goodcontracts_chat,5,okay contracts_chat,1,punish group 2 stillcontracts_chat,4,keep it at 5contracts_chat,5,first 5 then if we do worse back to 7contracts_chat,4,or all do what u did in round 6contracts_chat,2,yescontracts_chat,4,?contracts_chat,5,keep punishing group 2contracts_chat,3,doing 5 is more profitable...one of the #2 keeps putting in 10+ so thats the one we gotta punish  wit hdeductionscontracts_chat,2,but we know #1 is going to be greedy so what do we docontracts_chat,3,"group 1 or group 2.  if they go over 5, deduct 5"contracts_chat,2,yescontracts_chat,5,is anyone decducting from group 2contracts_chat,1,5 it iscontracts_chat,3,it will be too costly for them to do it againcontracts_chat,4,promise this time?contracts_chat,4,so 5contracts_chat,4,then 7contracts_chat,3,we gotta go balls deep on that #2...like gangbang balls deepcontracts_chat,2,hahahacontracts_chat,3,im doing what i saidcontracts_chat,5,hahahacontracts_chat,4,breathecontracts_chat,2,they are lieing so we put in less and they get a better pay offcontracts_chat,5,so punish two with 7contracts_chat,2,agreedcontracts_chat,5,and put in 5contracts_chat,2,that will teach himcontracts_chat,4,so what do we do?contracts_chat,3,if we all deduct they will get a smaller payoffcontracts_chat,3,5contracts_chat,GroupMember,textcontracts_chat,5,that last ome suckedcontracts_chat,2,clearly they arent following alongcontracts_chat,2,is anyone down for six eachcontracts_chat,3,is everyone deducting from group 2?contracts_chat,1,yeah theyre going crazycontracts_chat,2,i am deducting contracts_chat,4,i amcontracts_chat,3,the #2 are trying to fuck us overcontracts_chat,2,should we invest lesscontracts_chat,2,yepcontracts_chat,5,i put in 12 once as a decuction cz i was
