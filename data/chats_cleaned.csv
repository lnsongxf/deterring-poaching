is about 600,,38,8,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,3,yea 8 each maximizes payoff,,38,5,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,5,No because group 3 is investing more...,,38,7,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,5,Group 2 I mean,,38,4,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,5,should we lower our investment,,38,5,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,2,cus your payoff is a ratio of your input,,38,9,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,5,It counts their investment too,,38,5,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,1,if group 2 raises above 15 we have to increase because right now everone in the room is paying 5 so it is even,,38,24,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,5,we have to account for that,,38,6,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,1,yes we do,,38,3,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,2,"no, there is no better equilibreum",,38,6,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,4,okiedoke,,38,1,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,1,but if we do account for it,,38,7,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,1,there are only 3 members in group 2,,38,8,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,2,steadfast yall,,38,2,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,4,5 it is,,38,3,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,1,agreed,,38,1,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,1,then we can put a number in together that will factor that in to the equation,,38,16,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,3,we can go like to 48 and account for their investments,,38,11,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,3,"we got more at first because group 2 put in less of the payoff, but what we have going on is optimal",,38,22,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,5,sounds good,,38,2,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,5,Which number then? ,,38,4,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,2,8,,38,1,5,13.161,Zero,2,5,3,9 or 10

appeared to work better,,36,5,9,251,Zero,2,9,5,Should we still do 7?,,36,5,9,251,Zero,2,9,4,we should all invest 8 instead of 6.,,36,8,9,251,Zero,2,9,3,why 8,,36,2,9,251,Zero,2,9,5,No 8 is too much our payoff will go down,,36,10,9,251,Zero,2,9,3,"we got this, what is there left to say?",,36,9,9,251,Zero,2,9,4,instead of 7 i mean.,,36,5,9,251,Zero,2,9,1,I think we should have assigned nymbers to each person,,36,10,9,251,Zero,2,9,2,Because group 2 never invests below 10,,36,7,9,251,Zero,2,9,4,but the total payoff is higher than when we all invested 7.,,36,12,9,251,Zero,2,9,1,"I think 2 people should do 6, and the rest 7",,36,11,9,251,Zero,2,9,1,if group 2 raises it to above 15 twice in a row we shoud all raise to 6 to keep it even,,36,22,9,251,Zero,2,9,3,i agree,,36,2,9,251,Zero,2,9,1,which 2 people then?,,36,4,9,251,Zero,2,9,2,"nutin' lets keep up the good work, git muny",,36,9,9,251,Zero,2,9,2,"nope, 5",,36,2,9,251,Zero,2,9,4,okay let's try this.

too,,36,2,9,251,Zero,2,9,3,if we all do we'll all make less,,36,8,9,251,Zero,2,9,1,because if they all raise to 12 we will lose money,,36,11,9,251,Zero,2,9,3,ok so 2 and 4 are doing 6,,36,8,9,251,Zero,2,9,1,okay so person 4 and 2 do 6,,36,8,9,251,Zero,2,9,1,a lot of money,,36,4,9,251,Zero,2,9,1,and everyone else is 7,,36,5,9,251,Zero,2,9,5,Okay let's try
